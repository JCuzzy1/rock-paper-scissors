# rock-paper-scissors

# Begun with creating an array and assigning variables Rock, Paper, Scissors.
# Created my function called getComputerChoice to randomly return the variables.
# Used console.log and browser console to check results. It works! I'm getting random outputs.
# Created a function called playerChoice to give the user/player an opportunity to input rock, paper, or scissors. Did this by using input prompt(). Applied .toLowerCase to make it case insensistive.
